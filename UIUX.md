UI/UX
THe app uses alignment on the dashbaord when there are multiple slides. This means that the dashboard is always presented symmetrically.
THe presto app also uses harmonious colour combinations in order to make the app easy on users eyes.
THe app also uses consistent fonts throughout in order to reduce user confusion.
Affordance is used in many places inside of the application: 
- the arrows used for going between slides drop opacity indicating the button is no longer valid to be pressed when there is no slide in the direction of the arrow.
- The buttons on the application all use explicit affordance as they are labelled appropriately making sure that they do what they say they will do. This includes "new presentation +", "logout", "Login here"...
Colours throughout are consistant making it easy on the users eyes. Furthermore the contrast between the text colour and background colour are always high (light text on dark background or dark text on light background) hence increasing readability and usability.
The navigation bar is also implemented in order to allow the user to logout no mater where they are on the website.
Buttons present visual queues when hovering over them in order to indicate to the user that they are buttons.
Structure is also very good as content follows a logical flow down the page therefore increase the learnabiltiy of the program and hence increasing usabiltiy.
When editing components, current values for what the components details are are provided in the input boxes in order to increase usability and efficiency for the user
The inclusion of the error popups on the login and register page increases the usability through the use of feedback as the error popup states exactly what the user is doing incorrectly.
The entirety of the program has great consistency due to the styling of the webpage along with its consistant structure.
Program has safety as it requires the user to press the edit page button in order to modify the page at all. I.e. when just viewing the slides the user is unable to accidentally modify their current slide hence also increaseing 
usability and learnability as it is difficult to make mistakes.
